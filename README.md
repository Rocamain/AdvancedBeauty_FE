[Advanced beauty](https://advanced-beauty-fe.vercel.app/)

### What the project does.

- Display the content provide the content according the CMS
- Makes bookings to a data base api

### Goals

My main goal was to learn and create a full project with all the required needs for a functional beauty center. This back end is part of a major project which includes:

1. [Advanced beauty Booking Api](https://advancedbeauty-be-production.up.railway.app/).
2. [Advanced beauty CMS](https://advancedbeautycms-production.up.railway.app/admin)

Repos:

1- [Booking Api](https://github.com/Rocamain/AdvancedBeauty-BE)
2- [Strapi/CMS](https://github.com/Rocamain/AdvancedBeauty_CMS)

##### Personal goals:

- Master my skill with use of react and react router
- Create a calendar localize in specific time zone.
- Implement a front end with a nice ui.
- Learn new libraries.
- Achieve a good loading performance.

### Challenges

- Start form the scratch a project without knowledge of the most the libraries, mui, and day-js
- Create a navigation in conjunction with lazy component and the use of intersection observer.
- Update and migrate packages like react router.
- Learn Styled engine from Mui to style components.
- Learn to use dev tool from chrome and react extension
- use a third party Api, to get the back holidays for different locations.

##### Future improvements:

- Check how to implement a continuos integration with Github and test.
- Implement Cache policy on react packages.
- Implement a cookies policy.
- Continue the implementation of cypress.
- Clean code and try to make more DRY.

# GET STARTED

If you just want to test the app, you don't need to follow the installation steps. It already on production. [Web](https://advanced-beauty-fe.vercel.app/)

This project relies on CMS and booking system, unless you build those two repositories you will need to use the ones I made. which you can find them in env file.

---

## Install.

```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

as mui relies on react 16.

## Run it

```
npm run dev
```

## Test it

```
npm run cypress open
```
